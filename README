Installation:

You should have a copy of all files in the version repository. 
If you only want to install the MathMPS library to some particular folder issue

make install INSTALLDIR=/your/path/to/the/folder/you/want

This will install the MPS.m file in the directory and an Example.nb worksheet that explains (somewhat) how to use it.

Mathematica has, however, a problem with the routine that finds eigenvectors of 
large sparse matrix. Therefore, the standard installation will typically be very 
slow and use too much RAM (because it uses the internal Mathematica functions). 
This can be solved by installing an external function that solves the eigenvalue problem.
For this, you must have ARPACK installed in your system (look it up in Google). 
With ARPACK installed and compiled, you will have a library file typically called 
libarpack.a. Remember the name between lib and .a, for instance libMyArpack_x64.a 
will become MyArpack_x64. 
To compile the program you need a Fortran 95 compiler. Gfortran should do fine,
but I have tested it only with Inter Fortran Compiler (ifort). If you use gfortran
or other, you need to edit the ARmake.inc file, and probably the options passed
to the linker stage.
You also need to locate the MLink libraries that allow C programs to communicate 
with the Mathematica Kernel (if you have Mathematica, they will be in a default 
location). Finally, to compile the fast version of MPS.m you need to issue (all 
in one line)

make fast MLINKDIR=/dir/to/Mlink MLIBSDIR=/dir/to/Mlink/Libs ARPACKDIR=/dir/to/arpacklibrary ARPACKLIB=MyArpack_x64 

and then issue make install as before.
